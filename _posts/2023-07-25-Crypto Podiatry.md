The Dutch Association of Podiatrists (NVvP) launched the 'Dataspace' together
with the podiatry clinics Voetencentrum Wender, Podotherapie Hermanns, Innofeet
and the Saxion University of Applied Sciences.

The Dataspace allows members of the consortium to safely join data and learn
more about the effectiveness and value of podiatric care. The podiatry MPC
consortium is unique because it may well be the first federated healthcare
quality registry in the world; and it is in a relevant disease area (diabetic
feet) that costs 500mln euro per year in The Netherlands alone. The Dataspace
uses the MPC from [Roseman Labs](https://www.rosemanlabs.com), which combines
strong governance controls for the participants and strong privacy controls for
the data subjects.
