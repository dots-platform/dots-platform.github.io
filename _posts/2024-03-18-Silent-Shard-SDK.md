Silent Shard is one of the fastest MPC-based Threshold Signature libraries in the space. 

It is designed with a goal of providing usable, secure, and truly decentralized account management.
The core SDK is implemented in Rust and uses DKLs23 as its base protocol. The code has been audited by leading security firms, including Trail of Bits and Cure53.

Silent Shard is fairly customisable and has a wide set of wrappers to power mobile devices, web browsers and server nodes. 
The solution is used by digital wallets, exchanges, institutional asset management enterprises and key-management infrastructure providers.
