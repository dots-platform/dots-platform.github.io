Portal provides end to end embedded blockchain infrastructure tools so organizations can launch blockchain products with minimal time or effort.

Portal's secure, user-friendly design is considered best in class and opens access to use cases like DeFi, NFTs as digital asset collectibles, authentication, decentralized gaming, social media, and more. The Portal integration comes with various security features, including a firewall which automatically blocks malicious dApps, smart contracts, and addresses.
Portal’s Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) MPC wallet uses a novel two of two parallel threshold architecture that ensures users retain full control of their digital assets at signing, backup and recovery. With this design, organizations never take custody of their users’ assets and users can export their private keys to another wallet at any time.

Two of two means there are only two signing key shares and two backup key shares and both are required at all times. The key shares are never stored together; the wallet’s private key is never reconstructed. The end user always has control of one signing key share and one backup key share. Neither transactions nor wallet recovery can be completed without the user.
MPC wallets do not require users to set up a seed phrase. Users can sign transactions, store their digital assets, and access hundreds of applications onchain via the Portal Wallet.  Backing up the wallet is intuitive via Google Drive, iCloud or other storage method.

Portal provides a best in class developer experience with a lightweight SDK while maintaining fully featured integrations, such as the Wallet Connect v2 integration. Developers can spin up a working proof of concept with Portal in less than a day.
