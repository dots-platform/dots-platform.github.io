NCSC-NL accelerates the collection and distribution of sensitive cyber threat
intel, by offering a safe, and privacy-preserving environment for participants
to share information with each other.

It uses a Privacy Enhancing Technology called Secure Multi-Party Computation
(MPC), developed by [Roseman Labs](https://www.rosemanlabs.com), a privacy tech
company in The Netherlands.

With this new service, NCSC also takes a leading role in fostering the adoption
of Privacy Enhancing Technologies in The Netherlands.
