The Municipality of Rotterdam in the Netherlands uses [Roseman Labs](https://www.rosemanlabs.com)' MPC platform to provide additional educational support in a timely manner to toddlers with developmental delays, so they can start their school career without falling behind.

The municipality of Rotterdam has a statutory duty to ensure sufficient pre-school provision across the city for toddlers with (a risk of) a language and/or developmental delay. The Centre for Youth and Family (CJG) determines whether a toddler belongs to this target group based on established criteria. Childcare organisations in Rotterdam receive a subsidy from the municipality for the implementation of the pre-school programmes. Both the CJG and the childcare organizations provide data to the municipality for the purpose of monitoring the reach of these toddlers; this data is encrypted in each client's web browser, and then uploaded to the MPC servers. 

The municipality monitors how many toddlers have participated in a pre-school program (reach) and which have not (non-reach). By linking and analyzing the data using secure multiparty computation, the municipality gains insight into whether there is sufficient supply in the various areas and districts of Rotterdam, and whether targeted interventions are needed, without ever seeing privacy-sensitive information about individual toddlers.

"Instead of just conducting an analysis once a year, we now receive monthly reports on the state of affairs," says Ako Madomi, Product Owner of the pre-school program at the Municipality of Rotterdam.

The municipality now has timely insight into the number of toddlers who have been diagnosed with a (risk of) a developmental delay, how many of them have already been placed in a childcare facility with a pre-school program and how many have not. It is also clear in which areas and neighbourhoods these children are located, so that the municipality can carry out targeted interventions in the places where they are most needed, such as deploying additional staff or setting up further learning programs. 

The platform uses a three-party, honest-majority passively secure MPC protocol.
